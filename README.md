This is a text based adventure that I am working on. WARNING: Adult Language (Nothing too bad)
Not all buttons have full function yet but option 4 should be go back when buttons are not fully assigned
Kind of just threw a bunch of concepts I'm learning together
If you go to the tavern and insult a patron there is a simple fight mechanic though
it's currently bugged and not showing the patron attack screen it does still run 
the method so you will see your HP decrease and can die.
Proof of concept for bigger and better things to come.
